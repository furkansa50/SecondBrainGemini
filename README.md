A Fabric mod that brings intelligent NPCs to your minecraft world. Create player-like characters controlled by LLMs that respond to your chat messages and perform basic player actions.

**This mod works fully serverside. It must also be installed on a client for setup.**

> **State of Development**: (19.10.25) Fixing issues executing NPC tasks, Updating it to 1.21.1 and the latest mc version

## Requirements
      
- **Minecraft Version**: 1.20.1 (the latest version of this mod only supports 1.20.1 currently)
- **Running Ollama server OR Player2 App OR a Google Gemini API Key**

## Mod Installation

1. **Download the Mod**:
   - Get the latest version of the `SecondBrain` mod from the [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/secondbrain) page.
2. **Install the Mod**:
   - Place `secondbrain.jar` in your `mods` folder on your minecraft fabric server and client.
3. **Launch Minecraft**:
   - Start the Minecraft client and the server, and you're ready!

## Usage with Ollama/Gemini

>Note: Player must be an operator to execute the following commands

### GUI
- Open the gui with the `/secondbrain` command and create/spawn, despawn/delete or edit the NPCs there.
- Also edit the base configuration there.


### ~~Commands (Deprecated)~~
>~~Warning: This command uses default ollama/gemini settings!~~

1. **~~Spawn NPCs~~**:
   - ~~Use the `/secondbrain add <npcname> <gemini|ollama>` (currently only ollama is supported) command to create an NPC. (Example: `/secondbrain add sailex428 OLLAMA)~~
2. **~~Remove NPCs~~**:
   - ~~Use the `/secondbrain remove <npcname>` command to remove an NPC from the game world.~~

**Interact with NPCs**:
- Just write in the chat to interact with the NPC.

## Setup Ollama
### Ollama (Local LLM)
1. **Download Ollama**:
   - Visit [Ollamas Website](https://ollama.com/) and download the installer for your operating system.

2. **Install and Run Ollama**:
   - Follow the setup instructions to install.
   - Start Ollama and ensure it's running in the background.

3. **Connect to the Mod**:
   - Use the gui to create/edit an NPC and put in the address to your ollama server (complete url with http://...; 
     if you're running your ollama on your local pc then you can just use the one that's already typed in)

## Setup Gemini (Paid, with free tier)

   - Recommended models: `gemini-1.5-flash`, `gemini-1.5-pro`, or `gemini-2.0-flash-exp`

## Usage with Player2 App

>The mod will automatically sync the selected Characters from the player2 App to NPCs in your singleplayer world.
If you updated a description/name in the player2 App you can sync these changes with the command `/secondbrain player2 SYNC`
It's not possible to change any configs from the Character with this mod.
